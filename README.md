## Cloudflare Proxy Configuration

If you choose to configure Cloudflare as a proxy, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Domain on Cloudflare**

   - Log in to your Cloudflare account.
   - Add your domain to Cloudflare if you haven't done so already.
   - Configure DNS settings to point to your serverâ€™s IP address.

2. **Enable Cloudflare Proxy**

   - In the DNS settings on Cloudflare, ensure that the proxy status is enabled (indicated by an orange cloud icon).
   - This will enable Cloudflare to proxy your traffic and provide additional security.

3. **Update phpMyAdmin Configuration**

   - Ensure that your `phpMyAdmin` configuration handles Cloudflare correctly by checking for the `$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']` header for the original client IP addresses.

## Notes

- Ensure the domain you input (if choosing options with a domain) is properly set up and configured on your server.
- If you choose to install MySQL, make sure MySQL is installed and configured before running the script.
